Dũng</title><description>Presently works as an iOS Engineer at CELEBe Korea Co., Ltd. and as a Research Associate at the School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, International University (VNU-HCMC). I have over 10 years of both practicing and actual experience developing for iOS and macOS. Since I was in sixth grade and iOS still adhered to the skeuomorphic design language, I have been the award recipient of numerous awards from city to national-level events for competitive sport programming, software and hardware development. I also conduct research in the fields of computer vision, computer graphics, augmented reality, applied artificial intelligence and on-device machine learning utilizing mobile applications and other Apple-oriented platforms. Beside the coding work, I am also a proactive graphic, branding, and motion designer.</description><link>https://verny.com</link><language>en</language><lastBuildDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 19:54:55 +0700</lastBuildDate><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 19:54:55 +0700</pubDate><ttl>250</ttl><atom:link href="https://verny.com/feed.rss" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://verny.com/posts/example-article</guid><title>Image</title><description></description><link>https://verny.com/posts/example-article</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 19:54:45 +0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><img src="https://verny.com/Asset/favicon.png" alt="Image"/></h1>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://verny.com/posts/first-post</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://verny.com/posts/first-post</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 11:16:00 +0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
